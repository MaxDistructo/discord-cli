# discord-cli
A command line interface for Discord. Requires a Bot Account and can also be used to write messages as your bot. This requires a bot token to sign in.

## Goal
Create a management console for bot devs to allow them to see exactly what their bot can do / has perms to do and fix issues with other perms. Also allows for sending messages as the bot instead of requiring a say command all of the time.

## Liability
This is provided AS IS and if your account gets banned on Discord or harm occurs to anything, it is on you.
