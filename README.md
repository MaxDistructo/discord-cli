# discord-cli
A command line interface for Discord. Requires a Bot Account and can also be used to write messages as your bot. This requires a bot token to sign in.

## Goal
Create a management console for bot devs to allow them to see exactly what their bot can do / has perms to do and fix issues with other perms. Also allows for sending messages as the bot instead of requiring a say command all of the time.

## Liability
This is provided AS IS and if your account gets banned on Discord or harm occurs to anything, it is on you.

## Archival Note
I have archived this project during a self Github Repository Audit due to changes in Discord's Terms of Service forbidding anyone from using such an interface like this.  The code will not be maintained in any way, shape, or form and is left up as a reference for CLI style interfaces.
